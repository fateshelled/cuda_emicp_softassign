Requirements
---

- CUDA 11.8
- PCL 1.12.1
- FLANN 1.9.1
- Boost 1.74.0
- lapack, blas


Usage
---

```
cuda_emicp_softassign [options]
```

This demo application finds R and t such that `min ||X - (R*Y+t) ||` for given 3D point sets X and Y.

At the start, the demo application popups a window where two point sets are shown.

### Example1
```
$ ./build/cuda_emicp_softassign -pointFileX=./data/P101.txt -Xsize=101 -pointFileY=./data/Qnew101.txt -Ysize=101 -emicp
```
This aligns P101.txt and Qnew101.txt (both of 101 points) by using EM-ICP.

### Example2

```
$ ./build/cuda_emicp_softassign -ply -pointFileX=./data/bun000.ply -pointFileY=./data/bun045.ply -pointsReductionRate=5 -softassign
```
This aligns bun000.ply and bun045.ply by using Softassign. Numbers of points in both point sets are reduced (randomly approximately) 5% of its original numbers.


### Other demonstrations

```
$ make -f Makefile.demo demo
```



### Options

#### Files of 3D point sets:
```
-pointFileX=filename
-pointFileY=filename
[string] Filename of two 3D point sets. Requred.
```
Format of file: in each line, x y z coordinates are stored. That’s all. Number of points are specified with Xsize and Ysize options.

#### Reduction number of points:
```
-pointsReductionRate=**
    [float] Numbers of points in the files are randomlyl reduced to ** % (approximately). default: no reduction.
-pointsReductionRateX=**
    [float] Numbers of points X in the files are randomlyl reduced to ** % (approximately). default: no reduction.
-pointsReductionRateY=**
    [float] Numbers of points Y in the files are randomlyl reduced to ** % (approximately). default: no reduction.
```
Example: `-pointsReductionRate=10` then the number of points is reduced to about 10%.

Note: if -pointsReductionRate exists, -pointsReductionRate{X,Y} are ignored.

#### Algorithms:
```
[-icp | -emicp | -emicpcpu | -softassign]
```
Choose one of these. default: -softassign is assumed.

#### Softassign parasmters:
```
-JMAX=***
    [int] Number of iterations for the annealing loop (1st loop). At first, the annealing temprature T is set to T_0, then T <- T*TFACOR at the end of each iteration. default: 100
-I0=***
    [int] Number of iterations with the same temprature (2nd loop). default: 5
-I1=***
    [int] Number of iterations for Shinkhorn’s row/column normalizations. default: 3
-alpha=***
    [float] parameter for outliers (see the original Softassign paper). default: 3.0
-T_0=***
    [float] initial temprature for the annealing process. default: 100.0
-TFACTOR=***
    [float] factor for reducing temprature. default: 0.95
-moutlier=***
    [float] values of elements in the extra row/column for outliers (see the original Softassign paper). default: 1/sqrtf(T_0)*expf(-1.0f)
```

#### ICP parameter:
````
-maxIteration=***
    [int] Number of ICP iterations. default: 30
````

#### EM-ICP parameters:
````
-sigma_p2=***
    [float] initial value for the main loop. sigma_p2 <- sigma_p2 * sigma_factor  at the end of each iteration while sigma_p2 > sigam_inf. default: 0.01
-sigma_inf=***
    [float] minimum value of sigma_p2. default: 0.00001
-sigma_factor=***
    [float] facfor for reducing sigma_p2. default: 0.9
-d_02=***
    [float] values for outlier (see EM-ICP paper). default: 0.01
````

#### MISC:
````
-noviewer
    No viewer is shown. Just align point sets, and quit.
-notimer
    No timer is shown.
-nostop
    No interatction by the viewer is required.
````

####  Save and load R, t:
```
-saveRTtoFile=filename
    save the estimated rotation matrix and translation vector. default: nothing saved.
-loadRTfromFile=filename
    load initial values for rotation matrix R and translation vector t. default: no values are loaded, and set R=3x3 identity matrix, t=zero vector.
```

Save and load format: R and t are stored in row-wise.
```
r11 r12 r13
r21 r22 r23
r31 r32 r33
tx ty tz
```

#### align scales
```
-alignScaleOnce
     two point clouds are aligned in scales at the beginning.
```


Build the demo application
---

testd on Ubunts 14.04LTS

### prepare packages:
```
sudo apt-get install libpcl-1.7-all-dev libflann-dev libboost-all-dev ccache libatlas-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev cmake
```

### build
```
mkdir build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=1 ..
```




How to use the API
---

### interfaces:
```
void        icp(const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_targetX,
		const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_sourceY,float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
void softassign(const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_targetX,
		const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_sourceY, float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
void      emicp(const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_targetX,
		const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_sourceY,float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
void   emicpcpu(const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_targetX,
		const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud_sourceY,float* h_R, float* h_t, registrationParameters param)
```

To use these functions,
compile your program with either `icp.cpp`, `softassign.cu`, `emicp.cu`, or `emicp_cpu.cpp` along with  `3dregistration.h`.

### description
```
cloud_targetX, cloud_sourceY [Input]
```
Specify the pointers to pcl::PointCloud storing point sets X and Y.

```
float* h_R, float* h_t [Input/Output]
```
- On entry, initial values for rotation matrix R and translation vector t must be given. Usually, R=3x3 identity matrix, t=zero vector.
- On exit, estimated R and t are stored.
- Order of elements:
```
h_R[0], ..., h_R[8]: r11 r12 r13 r21 r22 r23 r31 r32 r33
h_t[0], ..., h_t[2] : tx,ty,tz
```

```
registrationParameters param [Input]
```
parameters for alignment. set values by yourself.
see 3dregistration.h and usage of demo (described above).

### with/without demo viewer
If you do not use the viewer, define
```
#define NOVIEWER
```
when compling icp.cpp, softassign.cu, emicp.cu, or emicp_cpu.cpp.
